# Releases

All releases should be on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/lbutils-mp/), and also published on [GitHub](https://github.com/dlove24/lbutils). A full log of the changes can be found in the source, or on GitHub: what follows is a summary of key features/changes.

## 2023-04-16: lbutils 0.2.5

### New

- Added package and class structure diagrams to the documentation to make navigating the code easier.
- Added additional ruff checks to ensure more consistency

### Changed

- Updated the type signature of the library methods to make static type checking easier. Also added `mypy` to the commit hook to enforce type checking, and updated the documentation to reflect the types of the module attributes in use more consistently.

## 2023-04-16: lbutils 0.2.4

### New

- Add a user `origin` to the `Canvas` library, which is assumed to be under the users control. This makes it easier for the user to specify a 'drawing origin' for the drawing primitives
- The `Pixel` class now has an `offset` for Cartesian co-ordinate offsets, and a `offset_polar` for Polar co-ordinate offsets. With the changes to the drawing primitives, this should make it easier to make small changes between calls to drawing primitives.

### Changed

- Changed the API of the drawing primitives to allow the user to either use the internal `cursor` by default: or to use an ad-hoc `start` co-ordinate.
- Removed the use of Boolean flags in the API, to make the intent of the API clearer to readers of the code. This is now also checked by `ruff` and enforced on code commit.

## 2023-04-14: lbutils 0.2.3

### Changed

- Re-organise the `Canvas` library to use the internal `cursor` for the text routines. This makes the management of the writing routines the responsibility of the `Canvas` itself, and not the user of the `Canvas` (preserving encapsulation).
- Directly expose the `cursor` attributes as a helper for `Canvas` to make the movement of the `cursor` a little easier.

## 2023-04-14: lbutils 0.2.2

### Changed

- Use the new graphics API for the OLEDrgb pmod example

## 2023-04-14: lbutils 0.2.1

### Changed

- Link I2C driver infrastructure to the build

## 2023-04-14: lbutils 0.2.0

### New

- Rewritten graphics API, with support for abstract drawing and fonts
- Pmod library for support of the Diligent OLEDrgb pmod, using the new graphics library
- Helper libraries for network set-up on the Pico W
- Support libraries for font, pixel and colours

### Changed

- Move to Read The Docs as the offical documentation repository
- Use 'mkdocs' to build the documentation for the library
- Move to using 'ruff' instead of 'flake8' as the lint and code sanity checker.

## 2023-03-29: lbutils 0.1.1

### New

- Decimal and hexadecimal display drivers for a seven segment display

## Pre-Release: lbutils 0.1.2

### Changed

- Documentation moved from `pdoc3` back to `pdoc` as the offical generator
