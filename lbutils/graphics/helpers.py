### Classes

class Pen:
    """Implements a convenience class for the graphics library, which represents
    a 'pen' with a specified foreground and background colour, and thickness.
    The primary purpose of this class is to make it easy to swap between common
    colour and line values; for instance using two pens to allow a swap between
    'highlight' and 'normal' text colours. This can be accomplished by defining
    the foreground and background colour of the
    [`Canvas`][lbutils.graphics.Canvas] as needed: this class simply makes that
    switch easier.

    Example
    -------

    Two new pens can be defined for 'normal' and 'alert' text as

    ````python
    normal_text = Pen(COLOUR_WHITE)
    alert_text = Pen(COLOUR_RED)
    ````

    This defines a `normal_text` pen with a white foreground and default
    background and line thickness (black and 1 pixel byt default). A second pen
    for `alert_text` has a red foreground, and similarly a black background with
    1 pixel thickness. Text can then be written on the canvas using these two
    pens on a `Canvas` as

    ````python
    canvas = Canvas(width = 96, height = 48)

    canvas.write_text(start= (0, 10), "This is normal text", pen = normal_text)
    canvas.write_text(start= (0, 20), "and this is alert", pen = alert_text)
    canvas.write_text(start= (0, 30), "Now everything is back to normal", pen = normal_text)
    ````

    Attributes
    ----------

    bg_colour: Colour, optional
            The background colour of the pen. Defaults to black.
    fg_colour: Colour, optional
            The foreground colour of the pen. Defaults to white.
    thickness: int, optional
            The line thickness of the pen. Defaults to 1 pixel.
    """

        self,

class Pixel:
    """Represents a Cartesian co-ordinate. Used as a convenience class for
    instances such as cursors where a relationship between a X and a Y co-
    ordinate must be maintained. This is also useful when two or more co-
    ordinates need to be tracked, or to be switched between. For instance an
    'origin' co-ordinate for a drawing, and a 'current' co-ordinate around the
    origin where lines are being drawn to and from.

    !!! note "Implementation Defined Origin"
            As for the [`Canvas`][lbutils.graphics.Canvas] class, the
            interpretation of the point '(0, 0)' is defined by the underlying
            graphics implementation. For instance the '(0, 0)' point may
            represent the top-left corner or the canvas, or the bottom- left hand
            corner. For details of how this point will be chosen (or changed),
            see the implementation of the specified sub-class of `Canvas` that is
            implemented by the chosen display driver.

    Attributes
    ----------

    x: int
            The X co-ordinate value.

            The Y co-ordinate value.
    x_y: tuple[int, int]
            A tuple representing the co-ordinate (x ,y).

    Methods
    -------

    * `move_to()`. Move the internal co-ordinate to the value (x, y). An alias
    for the [`x_y`][lbutils.graphics.Pixel.x_y] property.
    * `offset()`. Returns a `tuple` representing the (x, y) co-ordinate of the
    current `Pixel` with the specified Cartesian off-set applied.
    * `offset_polar()`. Returns a `tuple` representing the (x, y) co-ordinate of
    the current `Pixel` with the specified Polar off-set applied.

        --------------

        As the `x` and `y` attributes of this class are compared on each write,
        this class is by definition slower and potentially more resource
        intensive that the underlying `Pixel` class. If the costs of the bounds-
        check are not required, using the 'raw' `Pixel` class may be preferable.

                The parameter order is specified to allow easier definition
                in the common case where the lower limits for `x` and `y` are
                `0`, and the positional parameter order is being used. If all
                four limits are being used, consider the use of named
