"""Interface for the [Pmod
LED](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/pmodoledrgb/start) GPIO module. This
class is also an example of a minimal GPIO Pmod, and can be used as the base
class for more extensive implementations.

## Pin Layout

The table below shows the standard GPIO pin numbers for the Pico H/W on the the
Leeds Beckett micron-controller development board, using the standard PMod
header below.

!!! note "Check the Header Row in Use"
    The [`LED`][lbutils.pmods.gpio.led] Pmod uses only a _single_ row of the
    header pins at any one time. This means that _either_ Table 1 _or_ Table 2_ will
    be in use: but **not** both at the same time.

    By default the [`LED`][lbutils.pmods.gpio.led] class
    assumes the module is connected to the _upper_ header in Table 1. This can be
    changed to use the lower row in Table 2 in the constructor for the
    [`LED`][lbutils.pmods.gpio.led] class: but must be specified explicitly.

### Classes

class LED:
    """Provides a simple GPIO interface for the `LED` Pmod, allowing the control
    of four LEDS. This class assumes the Pmod is connected to the _upper_ header
    row: this can be changed by setting the `pmod_row` in the constructor as
    `pmod_row = PMOD_ROW.UPPER`.

    The interface to this class is deliberately simple, as the `LED` Pmod is a
    good example of a general GPIO module. This class is therefore intended to act
    as an example for more sophisticated GPIO: either by direct use as a base class
    or by the code examples.

    Attributes
    ----------

    led0: bool
        The state of LED 0. When `True` LED 0 is on; when `False` LED 0 is off.
    led1: bool
        The state of LED 1. When `True` LED 0 is on; when `False` LED 0 is off.
    led2: bool
        The state of LED 1. When `True` LED 0 is on; when `False` LED 0 is off.
    led3: bool
        The state of LED 1. When `True` LED 0 is on; when `False` LED 0 is off.

    Methods
    -------

    * `set_state()`. Set the state of the named LEDs in a single call.

    ## Constructors
    ##

    def __init__(self, pmod_row: PMOD_ROW = PMOD_ROW.UPPER) -> None:
        """Initialise the GPIO interface, and set all of the LEDs (GPIO Pins) to
        'off'.

        !!! note "Parameter Defaults for Pico H/W Dev Board"
            By default the `Pin` numbering for the upper row of Pmod connectors
            is used: if the lower row of Pmod connectors is required set the `pmod_row` parameter
            to `PMOD_ROW.LOWER`.

        Example
        -------

        A detailed example can be found in the `examples/pmods/
        pmod_led_example.py` folder. For the normal case, where the Pmod is connected to
        the upper row of header pins, the client only needs to call the constructor with
        the default values

        ````python
        # Instantiate the GPIO module with the default pin assignments
        # for the upper row of header pins
        led_controller = lbutils.pmods.gpio.LED()
        ````

        If the lower row of header pins is required, then the constructor argument
        **must** be set, for instance as

        ````python
        # Instantiate the GPIO module with the default pin assignments
        # for the lower row of header pins
        from lbutils.pmods.gpio import LED, PMOD_ROW

        led_controller = LED(pmod_row = PMOD_ROW.LOWER)
        ````

        Individual LEDs can then be turned on using the relevant attributes, e.g.

        ````python
        led_controller.led0 = True
        ````

        Similarly a direct assignment will also turn the stated LED off, as in

        ````python
        led_controller.led1 = False
        ````

        All the LEDs can be set to a specific state using the `set_state()`
        method, and passing in the state of the LEDs in order. For instance to turn only
        LED 2 `ON`, the client can call the method as

        ````python
        led_controller.set_state(False, False, True, False)
        ````

        Individual LEDs can also be named; for example the equivalent call to
        the above can be written as

        ````python
        led_controller.set_state(led0 = False, led1 = False, led2 = True, led3 = False)
        ````

        The use of named parameters in `set_state` also allows individual LEDs
        to be set (and named) directly, for instance as

        ````python
        led_controller.set_state(led2 = True)
        ````

        Note, however, that the state of LEDs which are _not_ named **will not
        change**. There is no 'implicit' state, and so the above is _not_ equivalent to
        the previous examples. The current state of the unnamed LEDS _will not_ be
        altered by this call: for instance the above example will _not_ modify the
        current state of `led0`, `led1` or `led3`.


        Parameters
        ----------
        pmod_row: PMOD_ROW
            Set the row (pin order) of the Pmod header to use. By default this
            class will use the upper row (equivalent to '`pmod_row = PMOD_PIN_UPPER`'). To
            use the lower row of pins set `pmod_row` explicitly as `pmod_row =
            PMOD_PIN_LOWER`.

        1. Using the `List` of `bool` values in the `leds` parameter to set the
        GPIO outputs. The first value in the list will be used to set LED 0, the second
        LED 1, etc. Missing values will _not_ result in a change of state.
        2. Using (some of) the parameters `led0` to `led3` to set the
        appropriate LED to the given state. These parameters can either be used as named
        values (e.g. `led1 = True`), or by position (e.g. `set_state(False, True)` to
        set LED 1). Missing position (or named) parameters will _not_ result in a change
