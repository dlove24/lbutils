"""Tests of the `colours` module using a normal byte order for words in the
colour conversion routines of the `Colour` class.

!!! note

Binary strings are used in the checks of the bit values to make it easier to
locate stray and incorrect bits. If a test fails, `pytest` should report the
correct binary representation, and the one received from the method.

Run as: `py.test test_colours_normal.py`
